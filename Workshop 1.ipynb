    "In this notebook you'll work with a wide variety of the most commonly employed tools in python. We'll begin with a brief overview of the history of python, how to set up your python environment and then declare your first variables! We'll talk about the different data types, and some of the more advanced data structures as well as foundational syntax such as for loops, conditionals and keywords. Then, we'll go into Numpy and play around with the new data structure it offers. We'll explore the uses of numpy and why exactly it shows up in every data science project out there. Finally, we'll go over pandas and how to use it to represent your data in a convenient way. A rough and guiding list of topics can be seen bellow: \n",

After the colon, all lines of code which belong to that function will be **indented** ending when we reach a line of code that isn't indented to match the function body. An **indent** in python is **4 spaces, not a tab**. This is often the bane of many new programmers. Jupyter is nice enough to automatically convert a tab press to 4 white spaces for you, but other programs may not be. Just be aware!

You may initially want to use a list or tuple, and that's a good instinct, but they're not as flexible as dictionaries. For one, in our case we have our months start at 1 and end at 12, but a list or tuple would index from 0 to 11. This is actually very simple to get around (we could just index by `MONTH-1`) but what if we had the opposite problem: given the name of the month, find its order in the year. Since we couldn't index by a String, lists and tuples wouldn't work. Dictionaries, however, have no such limitation! In general, if you are going to have many conditionals which simply evaluate the value of a variable against a fixed set of results, it may be worth switching to a dictionary."
