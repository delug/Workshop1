To say its *mutable* is to say that we can change its value mid-process without changing what entity we refer to (made clearer in example), while it is *immutable* if it cannot be modified after being created. The following are *immutable* data types: number values (including booleans), strings, tuples and frozensets.

To manipulate them, we introduce the *logical operators*: `not`, `and`, and `or`. If you've used other programming languages, it may be a bit weird to see the *logical operators* be written words, and not a mess of symbols like `!`, `&&`, `||`, but python was made to be as readable as possible, and hence opted for written words instead.

You may initially want to use a list or tuple, and that's a good instinct, but they're not as flexible as dictionaries. For one, in our case we have our months start at 1 and end at 12, but a list or tuple would index from 0 to 11. This is actually very simple to get around (we could just index by `MONTH-1`) but what if we had the opposite problem: given the name of the month, find its order in the year. Since we couldn't index by a String, lists and tuples wouldn't work. Dictionaries, however, have no such limitation! In general, if you are going to have many conditionals which simply evaluate the value of a variable against a fixed set of results, it may be worth switching to a dictionary."

This is an example of \"dictionary comprehension\". There's also an analagous system for lists and tuples, called \"list comprehension\" and \"tuple comprehension\" (kinda. It's a bit complicated for tuples). We'll focus on *list comprehension* since that is, by far, the most common use case. Understanding *list comprehension* will also make it super easy to pick up the other comprehensions (they're really all the same under the hood).\n",

This is a huge detriment to the readability of code since *somewhere* within our list, there could be a random break from the pattern.

    "As you can see, list comprehension provides us a much shorter way to accomplish our goal. Now we can talk about the readability of it. At first it may seem a bit odd, but there should be some familiar syntax in there! In particular `for ... in ...` is the syntax we used for `for` loops. You can think about this in the exact same way. The terms `for i in range(50)` define a for loop which results in values for `i` ranging between `0...49`. The expression *before* the for loop: `i+1` is what we would usually consider the *body* or content of the for loop. Let's look at the analogous for loop below."

    "So the expression `i+1` takes on values ranging from `1...5` in the code above, or `1...50` in our previous example. Putting this together, we can understand the code `i+1 for i in range(50)` as producing a *sequence* of numbers \\[in particular, it produces a `generator` when wrapped in paranthesis like `(i+1 for i in range(50))`\\]. List comprehension allows us to form a list based on this sequence of numbers. We do this by wrapping that code in square brackets like so: `[i+1 for i in range(50)]`. Now, this isn't the only way to do this. We could've also used a regular for loop and the ability to append lists to populate the list like below."
